For detecting benign and malignant masses in mammography images, several deep learning models have shown strong performance:

1. **BreastNet-SVM**: This model, based on AlexNet architecture, achieved a very high accuracy of 99.16% on the CBIS-DDSM dataset. It demonstrated excellent sensitivity (97.13%) and specificity (99.30%) by effectively classifying both benign and malignant samples.

2. **YOLO-based models**: Used for localizing and classifying masses, these models have been effective in mass detection and classification, particularly when combined with transfer learning【89†source】.

These models could serve as strong candidates for fine-tuning on your dataset.
