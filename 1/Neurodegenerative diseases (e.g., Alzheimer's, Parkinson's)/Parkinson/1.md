### Detailed Explanation: Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Multi-Modal Federated Learning

**Objective:**  
To develop a **multi-modal federated learning (FL) system** for detecting Parkinson’s Disease (PD), inspired by the ADMarker system for Alzheimer’s Disease. This would involve integrating various datasets that capture different aspects of Parkinson's symptoms, pre-processing them for training models locally on edge devices (at patients' homes), and using federated learning to combine the models in a privacy-preserving way.

### 1. **Key Components for Detecting Parkinson’s Using Multi-Modal FL**

#### A. **Multi-Modal Sensors**
- **Depth Cameras**: To capture gross motor functions such as walking, standing, and sitting down. This is critical as Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects motor control.
- **mmWave Radar**: For detecting gait disturbances, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability.
- **Microphones**: To capture changes in speech, which are common in PD (e.g., reduced speech volume, slurring, or monotone speech).
- **Wearable Sensors (Optional)**: These could include accelerometers or gyroscopes to detect tremors, which are one of the hallmark symptoms of PD.
  
#### B. **Federated Learning (FL) Framework**
The federated learning framework involves:
1. **Pre-training**: Using public datasets related to PD symptoms to pre-train models that are deployed on edge devices in patients’ homes.
2. **Unsupervised FL**: Leveraging local sensor data (often unlabeled) to fine-tune the model during deployment, using local optimization techniques.
3. **Weakly Supervised FL**: Using sparse labels (e.g., daily activity logs or caregiver-provided notes) to refine the model's performance on the local edge devices.
4. **Central Aggregation**: Periodically aggregating model updates (not raw data) from patients’ homes to refine a global model while preserving privacy.

### 2. **Datasets for Parkinson’s Disease Detection**

Parkinson's Disease datasets focus on several aspects of motor and non-motor symptoms. Below are some open datasets you can use to pre-train your models before federated learning:

#### A. **Motor Symptoms Datasets**

1. **Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)**:
   - **Description**: Comprehensive longitudinal dataset on motor and non-motor symptoms. Contains movement data collected via accelerometers and gait recordings.
   - **Key Use**: Pre-train models on data related to bradykinesia, tremors, gait changes, and posture instability.
   - **Source**: [PPMI Dataset](https://www.ppmi-info.org/)

2. **Gait in Parkinson’s Disease (PhysioNet)**:
   - **Description**: Contains gait recordings of Parkinson's patients using motion capture systems or wearables (accelerometers).
   - **Key Use**: Detect gait changes, slow walking, and irregular stepping patterns.
   - **Source**: [PhysioNet Gait Database](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/)

3. **mPower Parkinson’s Dataset (Sage Bionetworks)**:
   - **Description**: An open mobile dataset that tracks various motor activities like tapping tests, walking, and voice data collected via smartphones.
   - **Key Use**: Detect tremors, bradykinesia, and other fine motor impairments from sensor and mobile-based data.

#### B. **Non-Motor Symptoms Datasets**

1. **Parkinson’s Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings**:
   - **Description**: Contains various speech recordings of Parkinson's patients. Parkinson’s significantly impacts speech (soft voice, slurring, monotone).
   - **Key Use**: Pre-train speech models to recognize voice deterioration, detect hypophonia (soft voice), and slurring patterns.

### 3. **Preparing the Datasets for Federated Learning**

#### A. **Pre-processing the Data**
1. **Sensor Data (Gait, Accelerometer, etc.)**:
   - **Normalization**: Normalize sensor readings (e.g., accelerometer data) to handle variations in sensor types and placement.
   - **Segmentation**: Segment continuous sensor data into time windows (e.g., 2-second windows) for training models on specific motor tasks (walking, standing).
   - **Feature Extraction**:
     - Extract gait features such as **stride length, walking speed**, and **gait variability** from depth cameras and radar data.
     - Extract tremor frequency and amplitude from accelerometer data (for tremor detection).

2. **Speech Data**:
   - **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**: Convert raw speech recordings into MFCC features, which are commonly used for speech analysis tasks like detecting monotone speech and hypophonia.
   - **Segmentation**: Segment speech data into short frames (e.g., 25ms with 10ms overlap) to capture transient speech changes.

3. **Labeling and Weak Labels**:
   - Use weak labels, such as activity logs or caregiver notes, which can be associated with specific times and activities. For example, “tremor detected during meal” can be tied to corresponding sensor data.

#### B. **Combining Multi-Modal Data**
- Synchronize sensor data from different modalities (depth, radar, audio) to ensure temporal alignment. For instance, data from the radar detecting walking should match the depth camera recording gait.
- Combine the features extracted from various modalities into a unified format (e.g., concatenation of features from MFCC, radar, and depth cameras).

### 4. **Applying Federated Learning**

#### A. **Stage 1: Model Pre-Training**
- Pre-train individual models for each modality (speech, movement) using the public datasets identified earlier. For example, you can pre-train:
   - A **speech model** using the Parkinson’s Speech Dataset.
   - A **gait model** using the mPower dataset for movement-related features.
- These pre-trained models will be loaded onto the edge devices at the homes of Parkinson’s patients.

#### B. **Stage 2: Unsupervised FL**
- The models will collect **unlabeled local data** from the multi-modal sensors deployed in patients' homes.
- The edge devices will fine-tune the pre-trained models using unsupervised methods such as **contrastive learning**:
   - Train encoders to maximize the consistency between different sensor modalities for the same activity (e.g., walking) using techniques like **contrastive fusion learning**.

#### C. **Stage 3: Weakly Supervised FL**
- Edge devices use **weak labels** (e.g., caregiver or patient logs) to further refine models.
   - For example, if a patient logs a "tremor event," the system will automatically associate this event with the sensor data collected during that period.
   - Fine-tune the classifier layers to map the weak labels to specific motor and non-motor activities related to Parkinson’s symptoms.

#### D. **Global Aggregation (Server-Side)**
- At regular intervals, the models (but **not the data**) from the edge devices are sent to a central server. The server aggregates these models using **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**, producing a global model that benefits from the collective learning across multiple patients.

### 5. **Feasibility and Effectiveness**

#### A. **Will It Work?**
Yes, a multi-modal FL system for detecting Parkinson’s will likely work effectively, given the following factors:
- **Success of Similar Approaches**: ADMarker’s success in using FL for Alzheimer’s detection shows the viability of this approach for neurodegenerative diseases.
- **Availability of Diverse Data**: Datasets for gait, tremors, speech, and other Parkinson’s symptoms are available, making it possible to develop robust pre-trained models for multiple PD symptoms.
- **Privacy Concerns Addressed**: Federated learning ensures that raw data (e.g., sensitive speech data or movement data) never leaves the local devices, addressing key privacy concerns in medical monitoring.

#### B. **Challenges**:
1. **Data Imbalance**: Parkinson’s symptoms manifest differently among patients, leading to non-IID (non-identically distributed) data. However, techniques like **modality-wise federated averaging** can address this issue.
2. **Computational Resources**: Edge devices in homes may not have the computational power to train large models. This can be mitigated through efficient model architectures and pre-training.

#### C. **Potential Benefits**:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time detection of symptoms will enable earlier interventions and better disease management for Parkinson’s patients.
- **Customizable**: The system could learn to adapt to individual patients' progressions over time, providing personalized insights.

### Conclusion:

A multi-modal federated learning system for Parkinson’s Disease detection is both feasible and promising. Using public datasets for pre-training and leveraging local sensor data through FL, we can create a privacy-preserving, real-time system for

 monitoring Parkinson’s symptoms. While challenges like non-IID data and computational limits exist, the proposed method shows great potential to detect and track Parkinson's Disease in natural living environments effectively.
