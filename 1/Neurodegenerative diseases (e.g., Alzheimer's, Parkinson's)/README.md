### Integrating Multi-modal Data for Neurodegenerative Research
To apply **multi-modal federated learning** for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, you can leverage these datasets to integrate different data types. For example, in Alzheimer's research, you might combine **MRI scans**, **genomic data**, and **clinical records** to build a more comprehensive model that can detect early-stage cognitive decline.

#### Common Challenges:
- **Data heterogeneity**: Different datasets may have different data formats, resolutions (for images), or noise levels, which can make combining them more challenging.
- **Longitudinal data**: Many datasets provide longitudinal data, which is crucial for tracking disease progression over time.
- **Data harmonization**: Ensure that data from multiple sources (e.g., MRI scans from different machines) are harmonized so that models can generalize well.

### Conclusion
Yes, there is abundant multi-modal data available for both **Alzheimer's** and **Parkinson's** research. Using datasets like **ADNI, PPMI,** and others, you can apply **multi-modal federated learning** to create models that integrate data from various modalities, providing a richer understanding of disease progression and facilitating early-stage detection.
