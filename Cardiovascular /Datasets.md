**ECG**, **PCG**, **MRI**, and **Coupling Signals**. Each of these has distinct characteristics and uses, and they are often used in combination for more accurate diagnostics, particularly in cardiovascular and medical imaging research.

### **1. ECG (Electrocardiogram)**

#### **What is it?**
An **ECG** records the electrical activity of the heart over time. It is one of the most common tests for diagnosing heart conditions. The ECG signal reflects the timing and strength of electrical impulses that trigger each heartbeat.

#### **File Formats**
- **WAV** or **EDF (European Data Format)** for storing raw ECG signals.
- **CSV** or **MAT** files are often used for storing processed data (with time stamps and signal values).

#### **Characteristics**
- **Waveform Structure**: ECG signals consist of recurring waves, which include the **P-wave**, **QRS complex**, and **T-wave**.
- **Frequency Range**: Typically from **0.05 Hz to 150 Hz**, with most clinical information found between **0.5 Hz and 50 Hz**.
- **Duration**: Usually recorded in **seconds or minutes**. Commonly, **1–5 minute** recordings are used.
- **Sampling Rate**: Often **500 Hz to 1000 Hz**.

#### **How is it used?**
- **Diagnostics**: ECG is primarily used to assess the rhythm, size, and function of the heart, as well as to diagnose arrhythmias, heart attacks, and other cardiac conditions.
- **Example**: Identifying irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) by analyzing the spacing between R-peaks (the tallest peak in the QRS complex).

#### **Example File (CSV format)**:
```csv
Time (s), ECG Amplitude (mV)
0, -0.1
0.001, -0.05
0.002, 0.03
...
```

### **2. PCG (Phonocardiogram)**

#### **What is it?**
A **PCG** records the sounds of the heart, particularly the heartbeats, murmurs, and other noises created by the movement of blood through the heart and vessels. It is often recorded using a microphone or stethoscope.

#### **File Formats**
- **WAV**: Common for storing raw sound recordings.
- **EDF** or **MAT** files may be used if the signal is processed (e.g., for detecting murmurs or heart sounds).

#### **Characteristics**
- **Heart Sounds**: Two main heart sounds are recorded—**S1 (lub)** and **S2 (dub)**—which correspond to the closing of heart valves.
- **Frequency Range**: Typically between **20 Hz and 1 kHz**.
- **Amplitude**: Measured in **millivolts (mV)** or relative sound pressure levels.
- **Duration**: Recorded in **seconds**, with durations of **1–5 minutes** often being used.
- **Sampling Rate**: Usually **1 kHz to 5 kHz** for better fidelity of heart sounds.

#### **How is it used?**
- **Diagnosis**: PCG is used to listen for heart murmurs, valve defects, or irregular rhythms (e.g., detecting heart failure or valvular diseases).
- **Example**: Detecting heart murmurs (e.g., in cases of aortic stenosis) or abnormal heart sounds indicating cardiovascular diseases.

#### **Example File (WAV format)**:
```wav
// Contains raw sound data from a microphone or digital stethoscope.
```

### **3. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**

#### **What is it?**
MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique used to create detailed images of the organs and tissues inside the body. MRI provides high-resolution images, particularly of soft tissues like the brain, heart, and muscles.

#### **File Formats**
- **DICOM** (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine): The standard format for medical imaging, including MRI scans.
- **NIfTI**: Used primarily for storing 3D image data, especially in neuroimaging.

#### **Characteristics**
- **Resolution**: MRI images can be 2D or 3D, with resolutions ranging from **1 mm to 5 mm** depending on the machine and scan settings.
- **Modality**: Provides anatomical information (e.g., brain structure, heart anatomy).
- **Contrast Types**: MRI scans can use different contrast agents to highlight specific tissues, such as T1, T2, and proton density.
- **Data Dimensions**: MRI images are typically in **3D** or **4D** (for dynamic MRI).

#### **How is it used?**
- **Diagnosis**: MRI is used for detecting a variety of conditions, including tumors, brain disorders, spinal cord injuries, joint damage, and cardiovascular diseases.
- **Example**: Detecting a brain tumor or assessing heart structure and function (e.g., MRI for assessing myocardial infarction or heart failure).

#### **Example File (DICOM format)**:
```dicom
// Contains the pixel intensity data and metadata (e.g., patient info, scan details).
```

### **4. Coupling Signals (ECG-PCG Coupling)**

#### **What is it?**
Coupling signals are created by combining data from **ECG** and **PCG** to analyze the relationship between the electrical activity of the heart (ECG) and its mechanical activity (PCG). This is useful for a more comprehensive understanding of heart function, as these signals reflect different aspects of the cardiovascular system.

#### **File Formats**
- **CSV**, **MAT**, or **EDF** formats are used to store the processed coupling signals.
- Raw data may be in **WAV** or **DICOM** if it comes from specialized recording devices.

#### **Characteristics**
- **ECG and PCG Integration**: The coupling signal can be generated by techniques like **deconvolution** (mathematically combining ECG and PCG), which can improve the accuracy of diagnoses.
- **Frequency Range**: The coupling signal inherits characteristics from both ECG and PCG (0.05 Hz to 1 kHz).
- **Signal Processing**: Often involves feature extraction like **entropy** or **recurrence plots**, to capture subtle interactions between electrical and mechanical activity.

#### **How is it used?**
- **Diagnosis**: Combining ECG and PCG provides a richer dataset for detecting complex cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and arrhythmias.
- **Example**: Improved detection of CAD by analyzing both electrical signals (ECG) and mechanical heart sounds (PCG), along with the coupling signal that merges both.

#### **Example File (CSV format)**:
```csv
Time (s), ECG Amplitude (mV), PCG Amplitude (mV), Coupling Signal Amplitude
0, -0.1, 0.03, 0.05
0.001, -0.05, 0.04, 0.06
0.002, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07
...
```

### **Summary of How These Data Sets Are Used**

- **ECG**: Used for diagnosing electrical issues in the heart (arrhythmias, heart attacks, etc.).
- **PCG**: Used for detecting mechanical issues in the heart (heart murmurs, valve diseases, etc.).
- **MRI**: Provides detailed anatomical and sometimes functional information about the heart and other organs, helping in the diagnosis of structural problems and diseases like tumors or heart defects.
- **Coupling Signals (ECG and PCG integration)**: Used to combine the strengths of both ECG and PCG, improving the accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis by integrating both electrical and mechanical data from the heart.
