## Detecting Parkinson's Disease Using Multi-Modal Federated Learning

The methodology established in the paper "ADMarker: A Multi-Modal Federated Learning System for Monitoring Digital Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease" can be effectively adapted to detect Parkinson's Disease (PD). This adaptation involves leveraging multi-modal federated learning (FL) to monitor and analyze digital biomarkers associated with PD. Below is a detailed explanation of how this can be achieved, including potential datasets, preparation steps, and the feasibility of the approach.

### **1. Datasets for Parkinson’s Disease Detection**

To implement a multi-modal federated learning system for PD detection, various datasets can be utilized:

- **PhysioNet Databases**: 
  - The **PhysioNet Challenge** datasets contain data related to gait and movement disorders that can be used to train models for detecting PD symptoms. 
  - Example: The **Gait in the Wild** dataset includes sensor data from individuals with PD.

- **Open Movement Data**:
  - Datasets such as the **Open Movement** database provide accelerometer and gyroscope data from wearable devices that can capture movement patterns relevant to PD.

- **Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)**:
  - PPMI provides a rich dataset that includes clinical assessments, imaging data, and biospecimens from individuals with PD, which can be useful for training models.

- **Smartphone-based Studies**:
  - Studies like **PDLens** utilize smartphone sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) to capture movement data relevant to PD.

### **2. Preparing the Datasets**

Preparing datasets for use in a multi-modal federated learning context involves several steps:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Remove any irrelevant or corrupted data entries.
  - Normalize data formats across different sources to ensure consistency.

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Identify key features relevant to PD detection, such as gait speed, variability in movement, tremor frequency, and speech characteristics.
  - Use signal processing techniques to extract features from raw sensor data (e.g., Fourier transforms for frequency analysis).

- **Labeling**:
  - Label datasets based on clinical assessments or expert annotations. For example, classify subjects as having PD or being healthy controls.
  - In cases where labeled data is scarce, consider weak labeling techniques where partial or indirect labels are used.

### **3. Combining Datasets in Federated Learning**

In a federated learning setup, the datasets remain on local devices (e.g., smartphones or wearables), ensuring privacy. Here's how they can be combined:

- **Local Model Training**:
  - Each participant's device trains a local model using its own dataset without sharing raw data.
  - The model learns from local features extracted from multi-modal sensor data.

- **Model Aggregation**:
  - Periodically, the local model updates (weights) are sent to a central server where they are aggregated using techniques like Federated Averaging.
  - This aggregation allows the global model to improve while maintaining participant privacy.

- **Multi-Modal Integration**:
  - Utilize various sensor modalities (e.g., accelerometers for movement, microphones for speech analysis) within the federated learning framework.
  - Each modality can contribute unique insights into different aspects of PD symptoms.

### **4. Feasibility of the Approach**

The proposed multi-modal federated learning approach for detecting Parkinson's Disease is feasible and offers several advantages:

- **Privacy Preservation**: By keeping sensitive health data on local devices, patient privacy is maintained, addressing one of the major concerns in health monitoring systems.

- **Scalability**: The federated learning model can easily scale with more participants and diverse datasets without needing centralized data storage.

- **Robustness Against Heterogeneity**: The approach can handle diverse patient populations with varying degrees of disease progression and symptoms due to its decentralized nature.

### **Conclusion**

Adapting the multi-modal federated learning framework from ADMarker for Parkinson's Disease detection is not only viable but also promising. By leveraging existing datasets related to movement and speech patterns, preparing them appropriately, and utilizing a federated approach to maintain privacy while enhancing model accuracy, this method has the potential to significantly improve early detection and ongoing monitoring of Parkinson's Disease. Future research should focus on clinical validation and refinement of this approach to ensure its effectiveness in real-world applications.
