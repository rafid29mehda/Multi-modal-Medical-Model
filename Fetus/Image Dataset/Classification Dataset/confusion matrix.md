This is the **confusion matrix (normalized)**, which shows how well the model predicts each class of fetal health. Here's a breakdown of its meaning and what we can learn from it:

---

### **1. What Does the Confusion Matrix Show?**
- **Rows**: Represent the **actual (true)** class labels from the test dataset.
- **Columns**: Represent the **predicted** class labels by the model.
- **Values**: Percentages showing the proportion of predictions for each combination of true and predicted classes. Each row sums to 100%.

---

### **2. Classes in Fetal Health**
- **Class 0 (Normal)**: Fetus is healthy.
- **Class 1 (Suspect)**: Potential issues; requires monitoring.
- **Class 2 (Pathological)**: Fetus is in distress; urgent action needed.

---

### **3. Breakdown of the Confusion Matrix**

#### **True Class 0 (Normal)**
- **76.33% (Correct)**: The model correctly predicted 76.33% of Normal cases.
- **1.10% (Misclassified as Suspect)**: Some Normal cases were misclassified as Suspect.
- **0.31% (Misclassified as Pathological)**: A very small number of Normal cases were misclassified as Pathological.

#### **True Class 1 (Suspect)**
- **12.07% (Correct)**: The model correctly identified 12.07% of Suspect cases.
- **3.45% (Misclassified as Normal)**: Some Suspect cases were incorrectly predicted as Normal.
- **0.31% (Misclassified as Pathological)**: A small number of Suspect cases were predicted as Pathological.

#### **True Class 2 (Pathological)**
- **5.96% (Correct)**: The model correctly predicted Pathological cases 5.96% of the time.
- **0.31% (Misclassified as Normal)**: A small number of Pathological cases were misclassified as Normal.
- **0.16% (Misclassified as Suspect)**: A small number of Pathological cases were misclassified as Suspect.

### **4. Observations and Insights**
1. **Class Imbalance Effect**:
   - The model performs best for the Normal class (0) because it is the most common class in the dataset. This is a common issue when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
   - Performance for Suspect (1) and Pathological (2) classes is lower, as these are less represented in the dataset.

2. **False Negatives**:
   - Misclassifying Pathological cases (True Class 2) as Normal (Class 0) or Suspect (Class 1) can have severe consequences in a clinical setting. Fortunately, these misclassifications are very rare.

3. **Room for Improvement**:
   - The model struggles with the Suspect class, with only 12.07% of Suspect cases correctly predicted. This suggests the model finds it challenging to distinguish Suspect cases from Normal and Pathological.

---

### **5. Clinical Relevance**
- The confusion matrix suggests that the model is **reliable for Normal cases**, but its performance on critical cases like Suspect and Pathological needs improvement. In clinical applications:
  - **Misclassifying a Pathological case as Normal** is the most dangerous mistake and should be minimized.
  - Additional techniques, such as **data augmentation** or **class weighting**, could improve the detection of minority classes like Pathological and Suspect.

---

### **6. Possible Next Steps**
1. **Handle Class Imbalance**:
   - Use techniques like oversampling Pathological and Suspect cases or undersampling Normal cases to balance the dataset.
   - Alternatively, apply **class weights** in the model to penalize misclassifications of minority classes more heavily.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Explore creating new features or transformations to improve class separation.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Use advanced models like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) to capture complex patterns.
